within folder change folder procedure exmh line invoked from within exmh after script which is probably related to my not having an unseen sequence anywhere certainly not in inbox i read all of my outstanding mail before i tried this new exmh second i have been used to having a key binding which was to msg markunseen which does not seem to exist any more and i am not sure what i should replace that with there is obviously a way as the sequences menu does this the mark unseen menu entry in the message more menu is still wanting that function as well for those who have other sequences defined the window will widen to display the other sequences any chance of having that lengthen instead i like all my exmh stuff in nice columns fits the display better that is i use the detached folder list one column the main exmh window takes up full screen top to bottom but less than half the width etc i have space for more sequences in the unseen window as long as they remain once nice narrow window best would be if the sequences could be ordered by some preference then ones which did not fit would just fall off the bottom and not be shown i would also prefer it if that window had no unusual background colouring just one constant colour i have been running the unseen window with background black on a root window that is all black with no borders or other decorations but made sticky the appearance is just like the folders with unseen messages and their counts are written into the root window because it is sticky this small display follows me around and do i can see when new mail needs processing i also find that i tend to have a bunch of sequences that only ever occur in one folder some i had forgotten i ever created so in addition to the sequences to always show and sequences to never show a preference to only show sequences that occur in more than one folder would be useful and then have the sequences that occor only in the folder i am visiting appear in the list when that folder is current this is just to keep the list size somewhat manageable while remaining productive i quite often use a sequence to remember a particular message in a folder the name is used only there and only for one message it gives me a handle on the message which remains as the folder is packed sorted etc i have not updated my exmh for some time now so i am not sure if this next one is new or just new since but the sequences menu on the bar with new flist search only contains unseen and urgent it would be useful if it contained all of the sequences that the folder happens to have defined a new sequence entry would also be useful to mark the message with a sequence name that did not previously exist which can be done now using search and the pick interface but is clumsy that way actually you once could now when i try this entering a sequence name in the pick box and a single message number or a range n-n in the list of messages and no pick attributes at all i now get

changed the ftoc colorization as discussed briefly on the list a week or so ago any chance of making the current message a little brighter background just to make it stand out a fraction more than it

       "0  date tue aug from chris garrigues message-id i am hoping that all people with no additional sequences will notice are purely cosmetic changes well first when exmh the latest one with your changes starts i get cannot read flist totalcount unseen no such element in array while executing if totalcount unseen-sequence flaginner spool iconspool labelup else flaginner down icondown labeldown procedure flag msgseen line invoked from within flag msgseen procedure msgseen line invoked from within msgseen procedure msgshow line invoked from within msgshow procedure msgchange line invoked from

invoked from within eval procedure folderchange line invoked from within folderchange inbox msg show cur invoked from within time list folderchange procedure folder change line invoked from within folder change folder procedure exmh line invoked from within exmh after script which is probably related to my not having an unseen sequence anywhere certainly not in inbox i read all of my outstanding mail before i tried this new exmh second i have been used to having a key binding which was to msg markunseen which does not seem to exist any more and i am not sure what i should replace that with there is obviously a way as the sequences menu does this the mark unseen menu entry in the message more menu is still wanting that function as well for those who have other sequences defined the window will widen to display the other sequences any chance of having that lengthen instead i like all my exmh stuff in nice columns fits the display better that is i use the detached folder list one column the main exmh window takes up full screen top to bottom but less than half the width etc i have space for more sequences in the unseen window as long as they remain once nice narrow window best would be if the sequences could be ordered by some preference then ones which did not fit would just fall off the bottom and not be shown i would also prefer it if that window had no unusual background colouring just one constant colour i have been running the unseen window with background black on a root window that is all black with no borders or other decorations but made sticky the appearance is just like the folders with unseen messages and their counts are written into the root window because it is sticky this small display follows me around and do i can see when new mail needs processing i also find that i tend to have a bunch of sequences that only ever occur in one folder some i had forgotten i ever created so in addition to the sequences to always show and sequences to never show a preference to only show sequences that occur in more than one folder would be useful and then have the sequences that occor only in the folder i am visiting appear in the list when that folder is current this is just to keep the list size somewhat manageable while remaining productive i quite often use a sequence to remember a particular message in a folder the name is used only there and only for one message it gives me a handle on the message which remains as the folder is packed sorted etc i have not updated my exmh for some time now so i am not sure if this next one is new or just new since but the sequences menu on the bar with new flist search only contains unseen and urgent it would be useful if it contained all of the sequences that the folder happens to have defined a new sequence entry would also be useful to mark the message with a sequence name that did not previously exist which can be done now using search and the pick interface but is clumsy that way actually you once could now when i try this entering a sequence name in the pick box and a single message number or a range n-n in the list of messages and no pick attributes at all i now get

last though i tried adding a subject to pick on easy as i know what is in the message which made no difference looks as if something is now saying hit when before it did not or similar i have also changed the ftoc colorization as discussed briefly on the list a week or so ago any chance of making the current message a little brighter background just to make it stand out a fraction more than it does maybe this is more apparent to me than many as i use very small fonts everywhere the background of the ftoc line is not very wide hope this helps kre exmh-workers mailing list    \n",

a sensitive herbal botanical awakening if you will as we have introduced and brought to market aqueous kathmandu tm happiness drops temple quantum variety a k a secret fire secret fire indeed this liquid innovation affords us four factors within this particular botanical equation that were previously not realized the ability to engage a more substantial high-ratio concentrated application of particular botanical factors that are utilized in our personal-choice sensitive responsive pipe-smoking product the ability to extract high-ratio concentrates of certain botanical factors that are not applicable to a smoking commodity as they cannot be extracted into dry format please note all botanical factors included in all any of our products are absolutely legal in the instance of aqueous kathmandu we are simply able to enjoy the advantages of specific legal herbas that just are not dry concentrate-applicable a most notable assimilation factor being that liquid is more easily and therefore more generally metabolistically assimilated and as such more absolute in that herba botanical applications via the administrative vehicle of smoke possess a much wider variance in just how efficiently that smoke is integrated metabolistically psychologically and perspectively therein we have created a unique uniqueness between a smoke and a non-smoke sort of like the camaraderie between indicas and sativas if you will different aspects of the same botanical genus arrangement each impeccable singularly and at this juncture we will also mention to those of you who are not so anti-smoking something that aqueous kathmandu tm happiness drops and the more traditional temple ragga dagga tm personal-choice pipe-smoking substance indeed establish an enchanting camaraderie please

working or driving keep out of reach of children stoney mahoney in regard to the introduction of stoney mahoney tm personal choice smoking substantiality product we have strived for years to develop a consummate sensitive responsive loose-leaf smoking product amsterdam cup style so to speak with acquired knowledge via the development of such notable personal choice smokeables as wizard smoke tm dream smoke tm dragon smoke tm vajroli mudra tm stashish tm shemhamphorash tm yerba lena yesca tm weed tm kathmandu temple kiff tm which for the most part have been proprietary formulations of which the rights have been sold to other less aggressive less developmental companies we arrived at the lofty personal choice smoking status of our premier ragga dagga tm solid pipe-smoking product after all of this we had come to the technological and philosophical point of view that we could not conjure a loose-leaf formulation that would provide effectuality that would be more significant than that of our much-heralded ragga dagga tm solid-format pipe smoking product mostly we were right about this as this new stoney mahoney agenda is not so much significant as in better but signature significant as in uniqueness in that we chanced upon a new world class botanical source for the rare true-brid variety of artemisia absinthum flowering tops only which at one time in history was distilled into absinthe a greenish aniseed flavored liqueur which heralded certain euphoric and narcotic attributes which ultimately resulted in it being declared illegal as well we have finally perfected our exclusive kiffening technique which inspires and establishes alkaloid and glycoside potentiation enhancement on a molecular level hence we introduce although supply is limited this highly potentiated stoney mahoney tm smoking product loose-leaf personal choice doesn t get any sweeter than this and for all of you ragga dagga fans please note that indeed it isn t so much that stoney mahoney loose-leaf is more viripotent than the ragga dagga solid-format moreover it is that stoney mahoney is effective in a much different way than ragga dagga sort of like apples and oranges like panamanian and jamaican like indica and sativa if you will within our test marketing even traditional kind bud aficionados have magnanimously acclaimed this stoney mahoney jester variety most folks say that ragga dagga motivates them in an up sativa sort of way and that stoney mahoney mellows them out or giggles them out in a soma indica sort of way if stoney mahoney has any shortcoming at all it is quite simply that due to the extreme kiffening of this product it may be to the uninitiated practitioner a harsh draw it is for this reason that in addition to the inclusion of a standard herb pipe and package of rolling papers we also include a brass personal water-pipe hookah as is true for many high-minded folks a water-pipe filled with chilled water or wine will temperament the demonstrativeness of stoney mahoney s draw indica oriented definitely happy smoking mood enhancer smokeable brewable mood food good-bye stress anxiety restlessness sleep deep good-bye funky dreams

consummate sensitive responsive loose-leaf smoking product amsterdam cup style so to speak with acquired knowledge via the development of such notable personal choice smokeables as wizard smoke tm dream smoke tm dragon smoke tm vajroli mudra tm stashish tm shemhamphorash tm yerba lena yesca tm weed tm kathmandu temple kiff tm which for the most part have been proprietary formulations of which the rights have been sold to other less aggressive less developmental companies we arrived at the lofty personal choice smoking status of our premier ragga dagga tm solid pipe-smoking product after all of this we had come to the technological and philosophical point of view that we could not conjure a loose-leaf formulation that would provide effectuality that would be more significant than that of our much-heralded ragga dagga tm solid-format pipe smoking product mostly we were right about this as this new stoney mahoney agenda is not so much significant as in better but signature significant as in uniqueness in that we chanced upon a new world class botanical source for the rare true-brid variety of artemisia absinthum flowering tops only which at one time in history was distilled into absinthe a greenish aniseed flavored liqueur which heralded certain euphoric and narcotic attributes which ultimately resulted in it being declared illegal as well we have finally perfected our exclusive kiffening technique which inspires and establishes alkaloid and glycoside potentiation enhancement on a molecular level hence we introduce although supply is limited this highly potentiated stoney mahoney tm smoking product loose-leaf personal choice doesn t get any sweeter than this and for all of you ragga dagga fans please note that indeed it isn t so much that stoney mahoney loose-leaf is more viripotent than the ragga dagga solid-format moreover it is that stoney mahoney is effective in a much different way than ragga dagga sort of like apples and oranges like panamanian and jamaican like indica and sativa if you will within our test marketing even traditional kind bud aficionados have magnanimously acclaimed this stoney mahoney jester variety most folks say that ragga dagga motivates them in an up sativa sort of way and that stoney mahoney mellows them out or giggles them out in a soma indica sort of way if stoney mahoney has any shortcoming at all it is quite simply that due to the extreme kiffening of this product it may be to the uninitiated practitioner a harsh draw it is for this reason that in addition to the inclusion of a standard herb pipe and package of rolling papers we also include a brass personal water-pipe hookah as is true for many high-minded folks a water-pipe filled with chilled water or wine will temperament the demonstrativeness of stoney mahoney s draw indica oriented definitely happy smoking mood enhancer smokeable brewable mood food good-bye stress anxiety restlessness sleep deep good-bye funky dreams hornier than horny goatweed superlative mixer with ragga dagga and or aqueous kathmandu roll it or bowl it or brew it just a pinch goes a long long way possesses many fine ganja virtues with none of
